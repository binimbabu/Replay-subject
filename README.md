# ReplaySubject


ReplaySubject from RxJS is a type of Subject that has the ability to "replay" a specified number of previously emitted values to new subscribers. This functionality is particularly useful when you want new subscribers to receive a history of past emissions, even if they subscribe after those values were initially emitted. 


Key characteristics and usage of ReplaySubject:
Buffering of Values:
ReplaySubject maintains an internal buffer that stores a certain number of previously emitted values.
Replaying to New Subscribers:
When a new subscriber subscribes to a ReplaySubject, it immediately receives all the values currently in the buffer, in the order they were emitted. After replaying the buffered values, it then receives any new values emitted subsequent to its subscription.
Configurable Buffer Size:
You can specify the maximum number of values to store in the buffer when creating a ReplaySubject by passing a bufferSize argument to its constructor. For example, new ReplaySubject(3) would store the last three emitted values. If no bufferSize is provided, it defaults to buffering all previously emitted values.
Configurable Window Time:
In addition to bufferSize, you can also specify a windowTime argument. This defines a duration for which values are kept in the buffer. Values older than the specified windowTime are removed from the buffer, regardless of the bufferSize. 
No Initial Value Requirement:
Unlike a BehaviorSubject, a ReplaySubject does not require an initial value upon creation.
